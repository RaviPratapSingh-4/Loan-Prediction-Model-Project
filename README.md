Loan Prediction Model Project

This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict loan approval outcomes and assess the risk of loan defaults. The project utilizes a dataset encompassing customer demographics, financial history, and credit scores.

Key Highlights:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled missing values and irrelevant columns in loan_data_set.csv.
Logistic Regression Model: Built a predictive model for loan approval classification, achieving [insert accuracy]% accuracy.
Feature Importance Analysis: Identified critical predictors, such as income and credit score, to enhance decision-making.
Extended Models: Explored advanced algorithms like Decision Trees and Random Forest to compare performance and predictive accuracy.
Economic Factors Analysis: Investigated the impact of external economic variables, including pandemic-related factors, on lending decisions and default risks.
Objectives:
Enhance predictive accuracy for loan approval systems.
Provide actionable insights for financial decision-making.
Support financial institutions in risk assessment and portfolio management during economic uncertainty.
This repository serves as a practical demonstration of applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems in the finance domain. Feel free to explore, contribute, or adapt it for related applications!
